App customized for longboarders trying to figure out hills to bomb

Algorithm: Take an arbitrarily large number of points along each road in the route, "n". Determine distance between points and elevation of each point. Thus, slope can be calculated. Store slope of roads between each road start and end. Find a maximum spanning tree.
